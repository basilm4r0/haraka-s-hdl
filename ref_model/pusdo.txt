we have 4 for loops in HarakaS: 
1st loop: loop 5 time cause haraka spec says that
2nd loop: loop n times, since n = len(P) /r,  r = 256 ( the rate), P: is the padded message
         for example if the length of my message is 300, then i should absorbe the message into the padding function to obtain a string
         a positive multiple of r. here in this example to 512 bit
         Hence: len(p) = 512 --> n = 512 /256 =2 -> n = 2 
3ed loop: loop for 2 times cause Haraka has 2 ASE rounds
4th loop: loop for 4 times since 4 AES round functions are required simultaneously to process a 512-bit state in parallel

P  = n || padd (r, len(n))  #  || : denotes concatenation
n = len(P) / r 
P = p1 || p2 ..... || pn-1
set s = 0
for y = 0 to 5-1 do
    for i=0 to n-1 do
        s = s xor (pi || 0^c)  # c(capacity) = 256 
        for  j=0 to 2 do
            for x=0 to 4 do
                x = ase(s[x])
            end for
        s = mix512(s)
        end for
    end for
end for
Set Z = 0
if d>len(Z) then
    Z = Z âˆ¥ Truncr(S)
    end if
M = Truncd(Z)
