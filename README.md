## About This Repository

This repository houses an **implementation of the HarakaS hash function** in **SystemVerilog**. The HarakaS hash function is Haraka v2 hash function with a sponge-based construction to support the arbitrary length of input strings.

### Features

- **SystemVerilog Implementation**: The core HarakaS function is implemented in SystemVerilog, ensuring compatibility with hardware designs.

- **UVM Environment**: [TODO: In progress ]

- **Resource Links**: This repository includes links to the relevant research paper and the official Haraka code.
